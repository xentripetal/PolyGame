# Lambda Systems 

I attempted to implement a basic LambdaSystem but without rusts trait system I don't think its very usable. The ergonomic
advantages are lost in the boilerplate. I'm leaving it in for now but don't plan on using them and will likely delete
them in the future.

Flecs.NET is going to add type safe queries in the future and it will invalidate a lot of what I already added so will likely
delete it when that is merged in.

I think in the meantime I will look at improving the ergonomics of ClassSystems.
