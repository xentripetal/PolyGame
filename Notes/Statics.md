# Statics 

## Initial Thoughts 
`06-03-2024`

Nez loves statics. From a design perspective I'd love to ditch all the statics and have everything handled with IoC. 
But I'm not sure how feasible that will be with how much intertwining Nez does. During my initial port I'm going to try
and use statics as little as possible and see how it goes.
